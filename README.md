# pythonISHE
Python based data acquisition system for inverse spin hall effect (ISHE) measurements.

RF generator is used to excite magnetization dynamics in a sample through a co-planar waveguide.

The inverse spin hall effect leads to a voltage induced in the sample.

The RF is modulated, and a lock-in-amplifier used to increae the signal-to-noise ratio.

ISHE is measured as a function of RF power, RF frequency, and magnetic field.
